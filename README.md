## Overview

This repository contains modules for an AI-based intelligent camera decision-making system. It comprises the following components:

- **frontend:** React-based user interface for interaction and visualization.
- **models:**
  - `voilencedetection`: Contains modules and models related to violence detection.
  - `weapondetection`: Includes modules and models pertaining to weapon detection.

## Problem Statement

### AI-Based Intelligent Camera Decision-Making System

Design and implement an AI-based intelligent camera system capable of:
- Processing video data in real-time.
- Identifying significant events within the video feed.
- Automatically making informed decisions based on identified events.
- Alerting the police sentry and the district police control room upon detecting suspicious activities.

This system aims to enhance surveillance capabilities by leveraging AI to automatically recognize and respond to potential threats observed by the cameras.
